# Usage 
Allow location services for getting sunset and sunrise times in current location. 
Run the application bundle called DarkSync, not the script file. 

In System Preferences, click on Users and Groups, and then Login Items, and add Dark Sync as a login item for constant monitoring.

# Known Issues
* Transition between dark and light mode isn't very smooth
* LocateMe can prevent the script from working properly due to wifi issues and geolocation, resetting wifi will fix it
* Sometimes the app will not quit, but going to Activity Monitor and forcing quitting works for now
